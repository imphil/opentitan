# Azure template for downloading pipeline step outputs and unpacking them.
#
# This template will download all artifacts from upstream jobs (which are
# expected to use upload-artifacts-template.yml) and unpack them.
#
# This template expects that a variable $BUILD_ROOT is set to a writeable
# directory; the results will be available in $BIN_DIR. See
# util/build_consts.sh for more information.

parameters:
  # Names of jobs to download a partial $BIN_DIR from.
